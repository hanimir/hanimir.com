        <h1>My approach to care</h1>
        <p>
          I take a collaborative, individualized approach to care. I view my role as helping patients access and
          strengthen the inner resources they already possess, meeting each person where they are. Psychotherapy is
          central to my work, with medications used thoughtfully and only when helpful or indicated.

            <h2>Relational, depth-oriented psychotherapy</h2>
            <p>
              Therapy is a space for reflection, emotional processing, and connection. My work is informed by psychodynamic
              and relational approaches that explore patterns, attachment history, and the meaning we make of our
              experiences. We move at a pace that feels safe and supportive.
            </p>
            <p>
              When helpful, we integrate mindfulness, somatic awareness, and skills-based tools to stabilize the nervous
              system and build resilience.

            <h3>Shared humanity</h3>
            <p>
              I am drawn to treatment modalities that emphasize shared humanity, including mindfulness-based approaches
              and psychedelic medicine. I value offering tools that have been meaningful in my own path of growth and
              healing.

        <h2>Psychedelic integration support</h2>
        <p>
          I collaborate closely with therapists and provide psychiatric oversight and integration support for patients
          engaging in ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. Integration focuses on meaning-making, grounding, and translating
          insights into sustainable change.
