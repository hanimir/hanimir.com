        <h1>About Dr. Hanim Ir</h1>
        <p>
          I am a board-certified psychiatrist and psychotherapist practicing in the San Francisco Bay Area and providing
          telehealth services throughout California. I entered psychiatry out of a deep interest in understanding people
          and relationships, and in how meaning, connection, and healing emerge after trauma and profound suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          My clinical training, alongside my own mental health journey, has shaped both my professional approach and the
          way I live my life. In my work, I aim to support others in cultivating greater connection, clarity, and
          fulfillment.

            <h2>Training & clinical experience</h2>
            <p>
              I completed my adult psychiatry residency at Stanford, where I served as Chief Resident, and pursued three
              years of advanced training in psychodynamic psychotherapy at the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis,
              with additional education at the Austen Riggs Center.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have received advanced training in ketamine-assisted psychotherapy through the Polaris Institute in San
              Francisco and enjoy collaborating closely with therapists, both as a prescriber and in supporting
              psychedelic integration work.

            <h3>Teaching & mentorship</h3>
            <p>
              I previously served as adjunct clinical faculty at Stanford, teaching psychotherapy to psychiatry
              residents, and currently serve as voluntary faculty at UCSF, supervising residents. I have presented
              nationally and internationally on the role of the arts and humanities in cultivating empathy, cultural
              humility, and resilience in medical education.
