          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            I entered psychiatry out of a deep interest in understanding people and relationships, and in how meaning,
            connection, and healing emerge after trauma and profound suffering. My clinical training, alongside my own
            mental health journey, has shaped both my professional approach and the way I live my life. In my work, I aim
            to support others in cultivating greater connection, clarity, and fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I take a collaborative, individualized approach to care. I view my role as helping patients access and
            strengthen the inner resources they already possess, meeting each person where they are. Psychotherapy is
            central to my work, with medications used thoughtfully and only when helpful or indicated.

        <p>
          I provide a systems-oriented perspective that considers individuals within their relational, cultural, and
          societal contexts. My practice blends evidence-based psychiatry with depth-oriented psychotherapy and
          mindfulness-based approaches.

            <h3>Shared humanity is central</h3>

              I am drawn to treatment modalities that emphasize shared humanity. I value offering tools that have been
              meaningful in my own path of growth and healing, including mindfulness-based approaches and psychedelic
              medicine.
